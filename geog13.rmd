In the summer 20201 I took an intro to GIS computer programming course based in R. I learned how to code and dabbled in some data science. Here is a collection of links I worked on!

## [Building a project website](https://github.com/cspelius/geog-13-2021/projects)

- In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages
- I was exposed to the basics of website construction, HTML, CSS, YMAL and markdown
- I also practiced forking and contributing to another repository
